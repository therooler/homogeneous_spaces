# Code for quantum gates from homogeneous spaces

Install Python 3.9 and install the requirements. The following three scripts can be used to reproduce the figures 
in the paper:
```bash
FIG1_su2.py
FIG2_compare_gates.py
FIG3_blochsphere.py
```
One can also run `reproduce_figures.py` to produce all the data and plots automatically.

The notebook contains a variety of methods to construct the horizontal subspace generated by a symmetry $K$ acting 
on a Lie group $G$.
